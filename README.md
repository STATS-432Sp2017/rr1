1. Create an account on http://www.github.com/
    + Choose your username carefully.
    + Fill in your profile information (real name, upload a photo)
    + This is public. Anyone who searches for you can see it.
    
2. Accept my Slack invitation to the course and send me and the TA (Gunchang) a message. It must say (at least) your Github username.
    + Again, choose your username carefully.
    + Fill in your profile information
    + This is not public. Only those in the class can see it.
    + I have to add you to our class before you can proceed. Keep this in mind, and don't leave this until the last minute.
    
3. Use git on your machine (do not edit it on the website, I can tell the difference) to fill in your name, github username, and slack username in the table below.
