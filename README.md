1. Create an account on http://www.github.com/
    + Choose your username carefully.
    + Fill in your profile information (real name, upload a photo)
    + This is public. Anyone who searches for you can see it.
    
2. Accept my Slack invitation to the course and send me a message.
    + Again, choose your username carefully.
    + Fill in your profile information
    + This is not public. Only those in the class can see it.

3. Use git on your machine (do not edit it on the website, I can tell the difference) to fill in your name, github username, and slack username in the table below.
